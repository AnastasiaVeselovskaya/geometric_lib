# Introduction
- Calculate uses easy-to-understand solutions for the most common geometry problems.

## How calculate works

Calculate.py uses three input parameters:
- fig - name of the figure in need of calculations;
- func - exact function you need to calculate (e.g. perimeter, area);
- size - sizes of the figure.

Calc also checks if all the arguments of your input are correct and runs a preferred function with them, outputting the result in command line.

Note that if func is stated as main calc is going to ask you to input values from the terminal.
